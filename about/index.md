## History
SG &hearts; IU was established in 2013 when it was announced that IU will be coming to Singapore for the Korean Music Wave (KMW) and 
Uaenas attending the concert came together to show their support for IU. Although the event was cancelled by the organiser, 
the fan club continued to expand and has been active ever since. SG &hearts; IU regularly organised fan meet ups and also sent 
handmade gifts to IU annually during her birthdays. The fan club also have many collaborations with international fan clubs to provide 
fan support for her drama filming and birthday.
