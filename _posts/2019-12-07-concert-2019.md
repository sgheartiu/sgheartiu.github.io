IU kept her promise from 2018's concert and had a 2-day 'Love, Poem' concert in Singapore on 6 and 7 of December 2019. 
SGHeartIU did fan support for this concert on behalf of Singaenas to show our support for IU!


## Concert Announcement
On 21 September 2019, IU announced during her 11th Anniversary Fan Meeting in Korea that she would be having a 'Love, Poem' concert tour and Singapore once again was one 
of the destinations. So once again, concert fan support planning starts...

[iMe SG](https://www.facebook.com/imesingapore/){:target="_blank"} is the organiser for the 2019 'Love, Poem' concert in Singapore. We worked closely with iMe SG to ensure 
a smooth fan support for the concert.

Due to an overwhelming response during the ticketing sale on the 7 December concert, an additional day of concert was added for 6 December!

## Fan Support Fund Raising
After the initial fan support planning, we started a fund raising campaign to raise funds for the various fan support projects. 
Donors of SGD$50 received a random chibi IU keychain. Donors of SGD$100 and above received a set of 4 [IU chibi keychains](https://www.facebook.com/sgheartiu/posts/1381289105379833){:target="_blank"} as well as other perks. 


In total, we raised over SGD$7000! Thank you Singaenas for contributing so generously to our fan support!

## Fan Support Event #1 - Distribution of Photocards
We also made and distributed fan made photocards on each day of the concert. 
Since our fan made merchandise went out in a flash last year, this year we prepared 600 sets of photocards for each concert day in anticipation of the high demand.

## Fan Support Event #2 - Photo Booth Standing Banners
Singaenas love to take instagram-worthy photographs. Therefore, we prepared 2 IU standing banners at the concert foyer so that Singaenas could take pictures with the banners as momentos.

## Fan Support Event #3 - Seoul Rice Donation
To let IU know that Singaenas are supporting her Seoul concert all the way from Singapore, we did a 100kg rice donation for IU's Seoul concert!

## Fan Support Event #4 - Day 1 Concert Flower Field Event
Because the IU official light stick was not available for sale in Singapore, we decided to provide green finger lights for all concert goers to be used throughout the concert.
We also provided all stall seats audience with a flower light, which was to be turned on when IU sings Blueming and Love Poem. 
The flower lights together with the green finger lights were supposed to create an illusion of a colourful flower field filled with fireflies.

IU complimented that the flower light event was cute and pretty. She thought that the flower lights were light sticks and promised to bring the light sticks to her overseas concert next year!

## Fan Support Event #5 - Day 2 Concert Hand Banner and Blue Ocean Event
Since day 1 concert goers were provided with green finger lights to be used as a light stick replacement, we decided to go with yellow finger lights on day 2 to differentiate them from day 1 finger lights.
All concert goers were also provided with hand banners to be raised when IU first started speaking after her first few songs. The hand banner message translates to "You like us so much, that's why you're back right?".
When IU sang 'Love, Poem', everybody also waved a flashing blue light on their phones to create an illusion of a blue ocean.

IU mentioned that this was her first time experiencing an opening event, and even responded to the hand banner's message with "I came back because I like you guys".

## Fan Support Event #6 - Fan Chant Guide Distribution and Download
To let all Singaenas prepare for the concert, we updated our fan chant guide at
[http://fanchants.sgheartiu.com](http://fanchants.sgheartiu.com){:target="_blank"},
so that Singaenas could practise the fan chants ahead of the concert. We also distributed a condensed fan chant guide on concert day, with a different picture of IU on each day.

## Fan Support Event #7 - Overseas Uaenas / Solo first-timers Meet Up
We understood that attending a concert alone or in an overseas country could be intimidating. Therefore, we organised a meet up session for overseas Uaenas and solo first-timers on both days of the concert!
We had volunteers stationed at the amphitheatre of Star Vista, wearing the Uaena neon armband, to help assist with the meet up. Many overseas Uaenas turned up and got to know each other. 
We even gave a fan pack to each attendee of the meet up!

## Fan Support Event #8 - Cake, Snacks, Bubble Tea for IU and Team
To thank IU and her team for their hardwork, we have prepared snacks and bubble tea for IU and her team, to show our token of appreciation.
We even presented a customised cake of IU "eating" the MBS building, referencing to the iconic instagram MBS picture which IU posted after her concert last year.

## Fan Support Event #9 - Gifts for IU
We prepared some gifts for IU on behalf of Singaenas. 
<br>
1. Gem biscuit (aka star biscuit) cushion. 
The star biscuit is a traditional Singapore snack that is known by all. IU calls her female fans <i>Star Candies</i> and her male fans <i>Biscuits</i>.
This star biscuit cushion is a word play on the way IU call her fans, and it represents all Singaenas.
<br>
2. Deck of Singlish cards. Since Singaporeans are known for our Singlish (Singaporean English slang), this deck of cards will be a fun way to introduce some Singlish to IU.
<br>
3. Singaena Exam Paper. Since IU mentioned that she love quizzes, this Singapore styled exam paper is a fun way to test IU's knowledge about Singapore and Singaenas.

## Fan Support Event #10 - Congratulatory Flower Stands
We sent a congratulatory flower stand to welcome IU back to Singapore. In addition, we also allowed international fan clubs to send their congratulatory flower stands.
These flower stands were placed backstage for IU, and subsequently displayed at the venue foyer for Singaenas.
We would like to thank the various fan clubs from Taiwan, China, Malaysia, Korea, Argentina, and Canada for showing their support in Singapore!

## Fan Support Special Event - SINGAENA ZONE
IU brought some snacks from Korea, wanting to give them to Singaenas waiting for her at the airport. Unfortunately, she had to go through the Commercially Important People (CIP) terminal and was unable to pass the snacks to Singaenas.
However, IU passed the snacks she bought to SGHeartIU and we distributed them to Singaenas on both days of the concert!
