IU kept her promise from 2018's concert and had a 2-day 'Love, Poem' concert in Singapore on 6 and 7 of December 2019. 
SGHeartIU did fan support for this concert on behalf of Singaenas to show our support for IU!


## Concert Announcement
On 21 September 2019, IU announced during her 11th Anniversary Fan Meeting in Korea that she would be having a 'Love, Poem' concert tour and Singapore once again was one 
of the destination. We were overjoyed to find out that IU had kept her promise from the 2018 concert to meet Singaenas again in 2019! 
So once again, concert fan support planning starts...

[iMe SG](https://www.facebook.com/imesingapore/){:target="_blank"} is the organiser for the 2019 'Love, Poem' concert in Singapore. We worked closely with iMe SG to ensure 
a smooth fan support for the concert.

Due to overwhelming response during the ticketing sale on the 7 December concert, an additional day of concert has been added on 6 December!

## Fan Support Fund Raising
After the initial fan support planning, we started a fund raising campaign to raise funds for the various fan support projects. 
Donors of SGD$50 will receive a random chibi IU keychain. Donors of SGD$100 and above will receive a set of 4 [IU chibi keychains](https://www.facebook.com/sgheartiu/posts/1381289105379833){:target="_blank"} as well as other perks. 


Due to the sudden additional day of concert, we extended our fan support deadline as we required additional fundings to support both days.
In the 46 days of fan support duration, we raised over SGD$4600! Thank you Singaenas for contributing so generously to our fan support!

## Fan Support Event #1 - Distribution of Photocards
Because we knew that Singaenas loves fan made IU merchandise, we made and distributed fan made photocards on each day of the concert. 
Since our fan made merchandise last year went out in a flash, this year we prepared 600 sets of photocards for each concert day in anticipation of the high demand.

## Fan Support Event #2 - Photo Booth Standing Banners
Singaenas loves to take instagram worthy photographs. Therefore, we have prepared 2 IU standing banners at the concert foyer so that Singaenas can take pictures with the banners as a momento.

## Fan Support Event #3 - Seoul Rice Donation
To let IU know that Singaenas are supporting her Seoul concert all the way from Singapore, we did a 100kg rice donation for IU's Seoul concert!

## Fan Support Event #4 - Day 1 Concert Flower Field Event
Because the IU official light stick is not for sale in Singapore, we decided to provide a green finger light for all concert goers to be used throughout the concert.
We also provided all stall seats participants with a flower light, which is to be turned on when IU sings Blueming and Love Poem. 
The flower lights together with the green finger lights are supposed to create an illusion of a colourful flower field filled with fireflies.

IU complimented that the flower light event was cute and pretty. She thought that the flower lights were light sticks and promised to bring the light sticks to her overseas concert next year!

## Fan Support Event #5 - Day 2 Concert Hand Banner and Blue Ocean Event
Since day 1 concert goers were provided with green finger lights to be used as a light stick replacement, we decided to go with yellow finger lights on day 2 to differentiate from day 1.
All concert goers were also provided a hand banner to be raised up when IU first start speaking after her first few songs. The hand banner message translates to "You like us so much, that's why you're back right?".
When IU sang 'Love, Poem', everybody also waved a flashing blue light on their phones to create an illusion of a blue ocean.

IU mentioned that this was her first time experiencing an opening event, and even responded to the hand banner's message with "I came back because I liked it too".

## Fan Support Event #6 - Fan Chant Guide Distribution and Download
To let all Singaenas prepare for the concert, we have updated our fan chant guide at
[http://fanchants.sgheartiu.com](http://fanchants.sgheartiu.com){:target="_blank"},
so that Singaenas can practise the fan chants ahead of the concert. We also distributed a condensed fan chant guide on concert day, with a different picture of IU on each day.

## Fan Support Event #7 - Overseas Uaenas / Solo first-timers Meet Up
We understood that attending a concert alone or in an overseas country could be intimidating. Therefore, we organised a meet up session for overseas Uaenas and solo first-timers on both days of the concert!
We had volunteers stationed at the amphitheatre of Star Vista, wearing the Uaena neon armband, to help assist with the meet up. Many overseas Uaenas turned up and got to know each other. 
We even gave a fan pack to each attendee of the meet up!

## Fan Support Special Event - SINGAENA ZONE
IU brought some snacks from Korea, wanting it give it to Singaenas waiting for her at the airport. Unfortunately, she had to go through the Commercially Important People (CIP) terminal and was unable to pass the snacks to Singaenas.
However, SGHeartIU helped to collect the snacks from the organisers and helped to distribute it to Singaenas on both days of the concert!
