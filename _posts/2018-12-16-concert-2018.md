On 15 December 2018, IU had her first ever concert in Singapore for her 10th Debut Anniversary! 
We did fan support for this concert on behalf of Singaenas to show our support for IU!


## Preparation
On 15 September, IU announced during her 10th Anniversary Fanmeet in Jeju that she would be having a concert tour and Singapore was one 
of the destination. We were elated that IU is finally coming to Singapore after her first supposed visit to Singapore in 2014 was cancelled. 
Singaenas had been waiting for 4 years!

We immediately conducted a meeting the next day to plan for the fan support. We also emailed all recent kpop organisers in Singapore to find out who would be the organiser. 
It turned out that One Production was the organiser and we kept in constant contact to discuss and to approve our fan support projects.


## Fan Support Fund Raising
We started a fund raising campaign for the concert fan support in order to collect enough funds to fund our fan support projects. 
Donators of SGD$50 and above received fan support gifts of IU photocard and [chibi fan art stickers](https://www.facebook.com/365013863674034/posts/1108846122624134/).

Within 10 days, we raised over SGD$1000! Thank you Singaenas for contributing so generously to our fan support!

## Hand Banners and Finger Lights
The most iconic fan support that we did were the hand banners and finger lights. We provided green finger lights to concert audiences for use throughout the concert as IU’s official concert lightstick was not for sale here in Singapore. 
The purpose of the green finger lights was also for IU to see a sea of green firefly lights from stage. During the concert, IU noticed it and commended Singaenas for the successful firefly effect!
We also provided a hand banner which says “Singaenas are shining brightly here”, which Singaenas raised during the encore when IU sang <I>Dear Name</i>.
We would like to thank the volunteers for being there so early to help place the hand banners and finger lights on every seats. Kudos to all the fans for the cooperation to make this project a huge success!

## Distribution of IU Fan Art Handheld Fans
We made 160 IU fan art handheld fans which we distributed to concert audiences a few hours before the start of the concert. There was an unexpected overwhelming demand for the handheld fans as Singaenas rushed to queue for it!
We also distributed banners and fingerlights to circle 2 (level 3) audiences as we were unable to place it on their seats due to lack of manpower.

## Snacks for IU Team

## Other Fan Projects
We also worked on several other fan projects in addition to the above mentioned ones. We were looking forward to executing them as we were sure that 
IU and Singaenas will love them. Those projects had logistics settled and were close to completion, but were unfortunately rejected by One Production.
Those projects will be kept into our archive and hopefully we will be able to execute them during IU's next concert in Singapore.


## Thank You Singaenas
Although some of our fan projects were rejected, we did some awesome projects and was also recognised by IU. We hope that IU had a memorable time in Singapore. 
As this was our first time doing a fan support of such scale, we hope that Singaenas forgive us for any minor hiccups. We have learnt and will strive to provide an even better fan support for IU’s next concert! 
We would like to thank all Singaeans for their support and cooperation, and hope that they had enjoyed the concert!
